abstract="In everyday understanding, the term ``political culture'' is associated with ``a civilized way of dealing with each other in politics, fairness, adherence to rules'' (Sarcinelli 1990, p. 31). In political science, however, ``political culture'' refers to the population's value-neutral attitudes towards politics, their behavior and political mentality, symbols and ideas in a neutral way. After years of political and cultural stabilization of the Federal Republic, today only a few areas can still be described as exceptional in Germany: In general, the higher the degree of satisfaction or affirmation of the political system, the more abstract the subject is: political satisfaction is highest with the principle of democracy, already lower with regard to its constitutional form in Germany, and the lowest, if one approaches the depths of political confrontation. However, the dissatisfaction recognizable therein is not dramatic. Other Western democracies also live with a lot of dissatisfaction about their practice, there is also little trust in institutions and political actors/actresses there. But what democracy in Germany lacks are symbols, traditions, a historical myth to which it could emotionally connect. The national anthem hardly evokes any feelings of pride, there is no moving day of remembrance. It seems as if the history of German democracy were too much one of defeats, the positive aspects of which (early mass parties, early universal suffrage and high voter turnout, rule of law and federalism tradition) would have to be considered as negligible, to which the now positive reference, indeed a delicate pride in its own work on the past, could not change much. What is typical ``German'' about all this: the (however fading and often replaced by heterogeneity) regional contrast between East and West in a number of political and cultural issues, but also with a view to political extremism, a difficult, not always equidistant approach.",

abstract = {Using data from 28 countries in four continents, the present research addresses the question of how basic values may account for political activism. Study 1 (N = 35,116) analyses data from representative samples in 20 countries that responded to the 21-item version of the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ-21) in the European Social Survey. Study 2 (N = 7,773) analyses data from adult samples in six of the same countries (Finland, Germany, Greece, Israel, Poland, and United Kingdom) and eight other countries (Australia, Brazil, Chile, Italy, Slovakia, Turkey, Ukraine, and United States) that completed the full 40-item PVQ. Across both studies, political activism relates positively to self-transcendence and openness to change values, especially to universalism and autonomy of thought, a subtype of self-direction. Political activism relates negatively to conservation values, especially to conformity and personal security. National differences in the strength of the associations between individual values and political activism are linked to level of democratization.},

abstract="Although German bureaucracy is typically categorised as Weberian, a clear distinction between politics and administration has never been a defining characteristic of the German political-administrative system. Many close interrelations and interactions between elected politicians and appointed civil servants can be observed at all levels of administration. Higher-ranking civil servants in Germany are used to and generally appreciate the functional politicisation of their jobs, that is their close involvement in all stages of the policy process, from policy formation, goal definition, negotiation within and outside government to the implementation and evaluation of policies. For top positions, therefore, a class of `political civil servants' is a special feature of the German system, and obtaining `political craft' has become an important part of the learning and job experience of higher-ranking civil servants.",

Comparative analysis of the sources of social cleavage and party affiliation is explored by means of relatively comparable bodies of survey research data for West sermany, Great Britain, and the United States. One model of analysis, that of "middle-majority politics," which emphasized the emergence of middle-class type occupations and the continuous decline of dessensus and ideologically based issues, is rejected. Instead, a model of "consensus and cleavage" is offered which assumes a transformation in social-class-based politics but points to the manifestation of political conflict rooted in new and more differentiated social groupings which reflect economic, professional, and bureaucratic interests. Party affiliation is most related to social class in Great Britain, next in west Germany, and least in the United States; in each nation different social-structural variables operated as the secondary basis of cleavages in party affiliation.},

In theoretical terms the research interest lies in the question of the extent to which the new social movements in Germany are responsible for a change in the nature of the party system. Particular attention is given to the historical and electoral ties as well as the value system and the ideological orientation of the Green voters and the followers of new social movements. Their over-all impact on future party system is still controversial: on the one hand, the Greens could prepare the way for a dealignment, and on the other hand they could determine the process of realignment within the German party system.},

    abstract = { In September 2015, Germany opened its doors to refugees arriving via the Balkan Route. The influx of refugees generated support and solidarity among individuals, civil society groups and political and cultural institutions and various social movements. In this article, I analyse the frames proffered by two pro-refugee groups based in Berlin and contrast them with the propagated media counter frames which ultimately dominated the public discourse. I demonstrate that despite an explicit intention and commitment to foster support for refugees, the pro-refugee groups’ choice of frames could have been more strategic if they would have not neglected media counter frames. I argue that although the literature’s focus on dynamics of movement and media frames has provided useful tools for analysing the relation between the two, engaging with media counter frames is as equally important, especially if we are concerned with questions around strategy and the outcomes of social mobilizations. Empirically, this article provides a unique insight into micro politics of pro-refugee mobilizations in Europe. Theoretically, it contributes to a better understanding of media and movement frames by emphasizing the significance of dynamic engagement with media counter frames for creation of progressive political alliances with the wider public. }

ABSTRACT={While the political communication and participation activities of young adults are changing, this is often not adequately captured by research due to a too narrow conceptualization of the phenomenon. Our approach conceptualizes political communication as activities comprising the reception of political content, interpersonal communication regarding political issues and political participation. On this basis, we investigated the patterns of political communication in the young generation and factors influencing the formation of different political communication patterns. Results of cluster analyses demonstrated that young adults in Germany should not be seen as a homogeneous group. Rather, we found six communication types. Interestingly, no online-only type of political communication was revealed. By applying multinomial logistic regression analysis, we were able to demonstrate that socio-demographic variables, individual resources and cognitive involvement in politics influence the likelihood of belonging to more active political communication types.}}

According to arguments in the literature on the local public sphere and in political science, processes of communication and opinion formation differ at the local and national levels. However, opinion formation about national and local issues has yet to be compared systematically. This study analyses differences in the communication processes at the local and national levels in Germany based on a survey (n = 1014). The results demonstrate that opinions about local and national issues are predisposed, and hardly any media effects occur. Respondents’ opinions about local issues are formed more systematically, and interpersonal discussions can be influential while opinions about national issues are based less on personal relevance. In sum, opinion formation processes differ at local and national levels but not always in the way it is often assumed in the existing literature. }

In this article, we describe and explain such cooperative behavior in European Union policy-making by analyzing the information networks that parliamentarians of the Bundestag entertain with other party politicians and with interest groups. First, we describe whom parliamentarians cooperate with to receive policy information. Subsequently, we identify different types of cooperation networks. Differences in the structure of these networks point to a political division of labor inside political parties which is driven by the need to organize political support in policy-making. Finally, we test the explanatory power of individual attributes, institutional positions and (shared) political interests to account for the structure of parliamentarians’ cooperation networks. While formal positions and party ideology generally shape parliamentarians’ cooperation, their relative importance varies across different types of networks. The article contributes theoretically to informational theories of interest group politics and to the literature on national legislators’ behavior in EU policy-making. }
